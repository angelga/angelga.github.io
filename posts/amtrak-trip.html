        <h1>Review of long distance train traveling in Amtrak</h1>
        <p class="date">06-08-2016</p>
        <p>This a review of traveling in coach and business class on Amtrak's Sunset Limited and Coast Starlight trains.</p>
        <h2>Start: El Paso, TX</h2>
        <p>We boarded the Sunset Limited train in coach class. This train departs from New Orleans, and by the time it reaches El Paso it has already been driving for 17 hours. We were assigned seats at boarding time. I didn't expect to find the seats so filthy, with snack wrappings all over the seats, floor, and front seat compartments. The car reeked of body odors, not too strong, but noticeable. The restrooms were okay, but some of the sinks were clogged and the water was stalled.</p>
        <p>We did enjoy spending time at the Sigthseer lounge, and enjoyed both the coffee and the desert views.</p>
        <p>We didn't like the food quality. So in Tucson, where the train stops for about half an hour, we walked to an organic store nearby, and bougth a bunch of supplies for making sandwiches, and some fruit and snacks.</p>
        <p>The journey was generally pleasant otherwise, except for the air conditioner, which was at full blast, and we didn't come prepared with blankets and pillows. I didn't learn until later that blankets and pillows are available for sale in the caf&eacute;.</p>
        <h2>Connection: Los Angeles</h2>
        <p>The train arrived early to Los Angeles, at 4:40 am. I was worried about this since I've read so much about Amtrak delays, and we were making a connection later that day at 10 am. It was a bummer that there was no luggage storage in L.A.'s Union Station.</p>
        <h3>Business Class</h3>
        <p>We upgraded our L.A. to Seattle segment to Business class, and enjoyed the wait time at the Metropolitan Lounge. They had complimentary coffee, muffins, fruit and Wi-Fi availble. At 7:00 am we got off the train station, and headed to the historic hispanic district, where we had a really good and affordable Mexican breakfast at La Noche Buena restaurant. We mentioned to the owner that we wanted to buy a blanket, and he showed us to his store where we bougth a cheap and comfy blanket for our next trip to Seattle.</p>

        <p>We had big expectations when upgrading to Business class. We were promised better and more comfortable seats, good for enduring the 35-hour trip to Seattle without spending a fortune for the roomenette. However, the seats were identical to those of Coach class, with a little bit more leg room, but the same otherwise. We were given a couple bottles of water, and a $6 coupon. It was a letdown, but my main reason for upgrading was getting Wi-Fi access. That was also the biggest disappointment.</p>
        <p>The complimentary Wi-Fi was totally unusable. I didn't expect to be able to stream movies, but I couldn't even compose gmail messages. The guy in the back seat complained heavily to custumer service as he was planning on doing remote online work in the train, that's why he upgraded to Business class too. So the Wi-Fi didn't work, the seats were the same as Coach class, and the water and coupon were not enough to justify upgrading.</p>
        <p>Final notes about this class. Amtrak's site and all onboard flyers indicate that Business class passengers have access to the Parlour Car, but this is only for the wine tasting event, so you can't use it otherwise for meals or having drinks. Also, the cars didn't end up as dirty after 35 hours of riding, compared to the car in the Sunset Limited train.</p>
        <p>The rest of the trip had nice vies of lakes, rivers, forest, and large crop fields.</p>
        <h3>The experience</h3>
        <p>This route is very popular, and we always had a hard time finding a spot available in the Sigthseer Lounge. Many people spend all their time there, socializing, others use those seats for sleeping. When boarding the train we quickly sat on the left side of the train, and it was worth it as we could enjoy the long views of the California's coast.</p>
        <p>We were able to sleep comfortably with out new blanket, and we woke up early to enjoy the snowed mountain views in northern California, and later in Oregon's Cascades.</p>
        <h3>Final Destination: Seattle</h3>
        <p>Despite everything, this was overall a great trip. We enojoyed the breathtaking views, spending time in the lounge, the morning coffee, and talking to strangers in the train. We would definetely do it again, this time bringing a blanket, and more snaks for the trip.
